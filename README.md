# FYP - Frontend Repository

This is the repository for managing the frontend of my Gamified Learning Environment. 

Frontend:
• Next.js/Vue: Next.js makes use of Server-side rendering which should ensure fast load times and 
efficient handling of both the frontend and backend of my GLE within a single codebase. It’s also 
known to work well with microservices. Vue is an alternative option since it has reactive data binding 
built in. more research is required of me in relation to the possible use of Vue. 
• Tailwind CSS: For a clean and responsive UI design, especially for the gamified elements
